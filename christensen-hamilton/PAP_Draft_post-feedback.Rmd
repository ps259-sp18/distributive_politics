#Introduction

All the Sears papers: Sears et al. 1980, Sears, Hensler, and Speer (1979), Lau, Brown, and Sears (1978))

Voting behavior in sub-Saharan Africa is often focused on ethnic identity. Where ethnicity falls in the material self-interest versus expressive benefits debate is unclear. On the one hand, identity is often central to the notion of expressive politics [for instance @horowitz_ethnic_1985]. On the other hand, the instrumental view of ethnic voting suggests that citizens elect coethnics because it is welfare enhancing when the norm is to distribute goods along ethnic lines [@rothchild_modernization_1982].This line of thinking suggests that material self-interest drives ethnic voting. Several recent studies tend to support this instrumental view of ethnic voting. For instance, recent research suggests that African citizens do consider competence or incumbent performance in their voting decisions [@ferree_ties_2010; @bratton_voting_2012; @carlson_ethnic_2015]. Ferree argues that, in South Africa, racial voting patterns arise from voters using race as a heuristic to assess parties, not from expressive voting [@ferree_explaining_2006]. Moreover, evidence that region is more important than ethnicity [@ichino_crossing_2013; @basedau_how_2012; @ahlerup_ethno-regional_2015] and that social and political institutions can affect the extent of ethnic voting [@posner_institutions_2005; @dunning_cross-cutting_2010] would also tend to suggest that ethnic identities are not so deep-rooted as to be a primordial, identity-based, and expressive political response. On balance, the evidence would tend to suggest that material concerns are powerful drivers of voting behavior.

Our research differs from most of this pre-existing work in several ways. First, we seek to explain policy preferences in specific domains rather than voting behavior. Second, our discussion of material self-interest versus expressive politics eschews ethnic identity, as our data is insufficient to parse whether ethnic patterns are instrumental or expressive. Instead, we focus on predominantly on political ideology, which is less explored in the African context. Some of our analysis also focuses on xenophobic tendencies. There is a substantial literature on xenophobia in South Africa, but it is largely dominated by other academic fields [see, among others, @steinberg_security_2012; @tella_understanding_2016; @hickel_xenophobia_2014; @klotz_borders_2016; @ejoke_historical_2017; @vromans_experience_2011].

# Description of data

In this study we plan to utilize data from the World Values Survey and Afrobarometer surveys. The World Values Survey (WVS) is the largest and longest-running non-commercial cross-national survey of beliefs and values. The most recently completed wave surveyed participants from almost 100 countries in 2011-2014. Each country-level survey has a minimum of 1,200 respondents (ages 18-85), conducted through face-to-face interviews. Depending on the country, sampling occurs through either probability or a combination of probability and stratified random sampling as noted in the documentation. From these countries, we identify the five that are in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.

Afrobarometer is a long running survey designed specifically to understand political attitudes and behaviors in sub-Saharan Africa. Respondents answer questions on a variety of topics including public services, governance, identity, and political participation. There have been six completed waves, with the most recent in 2014/2015 also covering the most countries (36). Most country surveys have either 1,200 or 2,400 respondents. Each survey uses a clustered, stratified, multi-stage, area probability sample. Occasionally a survey will oversample a politically relevant sub-population in order to ensure a large-enough subsample.

From these two sources we identify the four policy preference choices available to us as listed above. In order for a policy preference question to be included in our analysis, the relevant survey also had to contain appropriate items to identify the self-interest and symbolic attitudes of respondents, hence why so few policy preference items were included.

For each topic we use different samples of countries based on the data available. The relevant questions on immigration and privatization are contained in the WVS and so is limited to those five countries. We limit our analysis of education preferences to countries where there is not compelling evidence of ethnic preference in education outcomes. We choose to do so in order to focus on the differences between material self-interest and political ideology, where the nature of ethnicized preferences as either instrumental or expressive is unclear. We thus select countries for inclusion using Franck and Rainer's results on systematic bias in primary education attainment and literacy [-@franck_does_2012]. We limit our analysis to only countries in which no more than one of their four indicators attained statistical significance. This leaves us with five countries: Benin, Malawi, Mali, Senegal, and Uganda.

#Hypotheses

$H_1$: Expressive benefit indicators will be jointly significant in each model.

$H_2$: Material self-interest indicators will be jointly significant in each model.

#Variable construction

##Immigration 

\textit{Source}: World Values Survey Round 6 

\textit{Countries included}: Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe

**Policy Preference**

(V46) When jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants. 

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Original coding}: 1 = agree, 2 = neither, 3 = disagree, -5 = missing, -4 = not asked, -3 = not applicable, -2 = no answer, -1 = don't know 

\item \textit{Recode}: 1 = agree, 2 = neither, 3 = disagree, else NA

\end{itemize}

**Expressive Benefit**

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (V107) How much you trust: People of another nationality.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original coding}: 1 = trust completely, 2 = trust somewhat, 3 = do not trust very much, 4 = do not trust at all, -5 = missing, -3 = not applicable, -2 = no answer, -1 = don't know.
  \item \textit{Recode}: 1 = trust completely, 2 = trust somewhat, 3 = do not trust very much, 4 = do not trust at all, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: discrete.
  \item \textit{Expected sign}: negative.
  \end{itemize}
  \item (V16) Important child qualities: tolerance and respect for other people.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original coding}: 1= mentioned, 2 = not mentioned, -4 = not asked, -3 = not applicable, -2 = no answer, -1 = don't know.
  \item \textit{Recode}: 1= mentioned, 0 = not mentioned, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: binary.
  \item \textit{Expected sign}: negative.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

**Self-Interest**

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Personal Connection to Immigrant}: We will create a single indicator for personal connection to immigrants using the following items. If any of these items is answered as yes (1 = immigrant), personal connection to immigrant will be coded as one, else zero:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item (V243) Mother is an immigrant.  
    \item (V244) Father is an immigrant. 
    \item (V245) Respondent is an immigrant.  
  \end{itemize}
  We chose to fold these items into a single index in order to overcome potential multicollinearity. \textit{Variable type}: binary. \\ \textit{Expected sign}: negative. 
  \item \textit{Employment status of primary household breadwinner} This indicator requires use of several WVS items: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item (V229) Employment status \textit{Original coding}: 1 = full time, 2 = part time, 3 = self-employed, 4 = retired, 5 = housewife, 6 = students, 7 = unemployed, 8 = other, -4 = not asked, -3 = not applicable, -2 = no answer, -1 = don't know. 
  \item (V235) Are you the chief wage earner in your house? \textit{Original coding}: 1 = yes, 2 = no, -4 = not asked, -3 = not applicable, -2 = no answer, -1 = don't know.
  \item (V236) Is the chief wage earner employed now or not. \textit{Original coding}: 1 = yes, 2 = no, -4 = not asked, -3 = not applicable (Repondent is the chief wage earner), -2 = no answer, -1 = don't know.
  \end{itemize}
  We will code 1 if either the primary wage earner of the respondent's household (either respondent or otherwise) is employed (full time, part time, or self-employed), else 0. \textit{Variable type}: binary. \textit{Expected sign}: positive.
  \item \textit{Supplementary analysis}: We will include the following items in supplementary anaylsis. However, we exclude them from our prefered model because they are subjective measures of personal well-being, and therefore subject to endogeneity vis-a-vis value expression. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item (V59) Satisfaction with financial situation of household.
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item \textit{Original Coding}: scale from 1 = completely dissatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied, -4 = not asked in survey, -3 = not applicable, -2 = no answer or refused to answer, -1 = don't know.
    \item \textit{Recode}: scale from 1 to 10 as above, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: discrete.
    \item \textit{Expected sign}: positive.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Original Coding}: 1 = very much, 2 = a great deal, 3 = not much,  4 = not much at all, -4 = not asked in survey, -3 = Inapplicable (neither has, nor seeks a job), -2 = no answer, -1 = don't know.

**Policy Preference**

(Q10) Which of the following statements is closest to your view?. Choose Statement A or Statement B. A: It is better to have free schooling for our children, even if the quality of education is low. B: It is better to raise educational standards, even if we have to pay school fees.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Original Coding}: 1=Agree Very Strongly with A, 2=Agree with A, 3=Agree with B, 4=Agree Very Strongly with B, 5=Agree with Neither, 9=Don’t Know, 98=Refused to Answer, -1=Missing Data

\item \textit{Recode}: 1=Agree Very Strongly with A, 2=Agree with A, 3=Agree with Neither, 4=Agree with B, 5=Agree Very Strongly with B, else NA. 

\end{itemize}

**Expressive Benefit**

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (Q19) Let’s talk for a moment about the kind of society we would like to have in this country. Which of the following statements is closest to your view?. Choose Statement A or Statement B. A: People should look after themselves and be responsible for their own success in life. B: The government should bear the main responsibility for the well-being of people. 
  \begin{itemize}

  \item \textit{Recode}: 1=Agree Very Strongly with A, 2=Agree with A, 3=Agree with Neither, 4=Agree with B, 5=Agree Very Strongly with B, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: discrete.
  \item \textit{Expected sign}: negative.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

**Self-interest**

Afrobarometer asks two questions in separate sections regarding the affordability of school expenses and fees. We include the first in our preferred specification. However, we will run models with the second item as well for a robustness check.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Public School Contact} Our self-interest items rely on having direct experience with the public schooling system. As such, we code a term for whether the respondent indicates having contact with the public school system. On each of the items listed below (Q73A-F), resondents have the option to respond "no experience with public schools in the past twelve months" (coded as 7). Our new variable is coded 0 if the respondent indicates "no experience" for ANY of the questions Q73A-F, else 1. We will interact this variable with each of the self interest variables below, effectively turnining it "on" or "off" according to contact.
  
  We do observe that the percentage of respondents choosing "no experience" sometimes vary from question to question. This is concerning, as respondents with any experience with the public school system should answer "don't know" or "never" rather than "no experience" for these questions if they have not encountered the problem listed. Because the responses of those who answer "no experience" for some questions but not others is ambiguous, we include all of these in the no contact category. \textit{Variable type}: binary.
  \item (Q73A) Have you encountered any of these problems with your local public schools during the past 12 months?. Services are too expensive / Unable to pay.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original Coding}: 0=Never, 1=Once or twice, 2=A few times, 3=Often, 7=No experience with public schools in the past twelve months, 9=Don’t Know, 98=Refused to Answer, -1=Missing Data.
  \item \textit{Recode}: 0=Never, 1=Once or twice, 2=A few times, 3=Often, 0=No experience with public schools in the past twelve months, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: discrete.
  \item \textit{Expected sign}: negative.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{School quality index} We will construct an additive index of school quality concerns, based on the following items:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item (Q73B) Have you encountered any of these problems with your local public schools during the past 12 months?. Lack of textbooks or other supplies.
    \item (Q73C) Have you encountered any of these problems with your local public schools during the past 12 months?. Poor teaching.
    \item (Q73D) Have you encountered any of these problems with your local public schools during the past 12 months? Absent teachers.
    \item (Q73E) Have you encountered any of these problems with your local public schools during the past 12 months?. Overcrowded classrooms.
    \item (Q73F) Have you encountered any of these problems with your local public schools during the past 12 months? Poor conditions of facilities.
  \end{enumerate}
  Each of these questions has identical response options:
      \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Original coding}: 0=Never, 1=Once or twice, 2=A few times, 3=Often, 7=No experience with public schools in the past twelve months, 9=Don’t Know, 98=Refused to Answer, -1=Missing Data.
    \item \textit{Recode}: 0=Never, 1=Once or twice, 2=A few times, 3=Often, 0=No experience with public schools in the past twelve months, else NA.\\
    Response for each Q73B-F will be summed. \textit{Variable type}: discrete.
    \end{itemize}
  \textit{Expected sign}: positive.
\end{enumerate}

**Controls**

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (Q90) What is the highest level of education you have completed?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original coding}: 0=No formal schooling, 1=Informal schooling (including Koranic schooling), 2=Some primary schooling, 3=Primary school completed, 4=Some secondary school/ High school, 5=Secondary school completed/High school, 6=Post-secondary qualifications, other than university e.g. a diploma or degree from a technical/polytechnic/college, 7=Some university, 8=University completed, 9=Post-graduate, 98=Refused to Answer, 99=Don’t Know, -1=Missing Data.
  \item \textit{Recode}: 0=No formal schooling, 1=Informal schooling (including Koranic schooling), 2=Some primary schooling, 3=Primary school completed, 4=Some secondary school/ High school, 5=Secondary school completed/High school, 6=Post-secondary qualifications, other than university e.g. a diploma or degree from a technical/polytechnic/college, 7=Some university, 8=University completed, 9=Post-graduate, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: categorical.
  \end{itemize}
  \item (Q101) Respondent's gender, as assessed by interviewer. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original coding}: 1=Male, 2=Female
  \item \textit{Recode}: 1 = male, 0 = female. \textit{Variable type}: binary.
  \end{itemize}
  \item (Q116B) Were the following services present in the primary sampling unit/enumeration area: School? 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original coding}: 0=No, 1=Yes, 9=Can’t determine, -1=Missing Data. 
  \item \textit{Recode Scaling}: 0=No, 1=Yes, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: binary.
  \end{itemize}
  \item (Q1) How old are you?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original coding}: 18-110 as indicated, 998=Refused to Answer, 999=Don’t Know, -1=Missing Data.
  \item \textit{Recode}: 18-110 as indicated, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: discrete.
  \end{itemize}
  \item (Q79) What is your tribe? You know, your ethnic or cultural group. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original coding}: : see AFB for full list, 990=National identity only, 995=Other, 997=Not Asked, 998=Refused, 999=Don’t know,-1=Missing Data.
  \item \textit{Recode}: As above, except NA for original codes 997, 998, 999, -1. \textit{Variable type}: categorical.
  \end{itemize}
  \item (Q81) How often are [respondent’s identity group] treated unfairly by the government?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Original Coding}: 0=Never, 1=Sometimes, 2=Often, 3=Always, 7=Not Applicable, 9=Don’t Know, 98=Refused to Answer, -1=Missing Data 
  \item \textit{Recode}: 0=Never, 1=Sometimes, 2=Often, 3=Always, else NA. \textit{Variable type}: discrete.
  \item \textit{Note}: Although we focus on countries without a history of ethnic bias in education, political preferences may nonetheless be driven by perceived ethnic bias, either in education or in other domains. As such, we include thsi measure to mitigate omitted variable bias vis-a-vis ethnically driven policy preference.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  
#Model

For each policy area, we will use an ordered logit model with policy preference as the dependent variable and with symbolic attitudes and self-interest indices as the independent variables. We will also include control variables as indicated above. 

##Immigration and Privatization Models 

These model will take the form:

\begin{equation}
y_i = \alpha + \textbf{X}_{i1}\beta + \textbf{X}_{i2}\gamma +  \textbf{X}_{i3}\delta + \pi_i + \epsilon_i 
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i1}$ represents a matrix of expressive benefit indicators and $\beta$ represents a vector of coefficients for each expressive benefit indicator.
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i2}$ represents a matrix of self-interest indicators and $\gamma$ represents a vector of coefficients for each self-interest indicator.
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i3}$ represents a matrix of control variables and $\delta$ represents a vector of coefficients for each control variable.
  \item $\pi_i$ represents country fixed effects.
\end{itemize}

Note that symbolic attitudes and self-interest are thus *not* summary indices (except in cases indicated under variable construction); rather, each indictor is entered individually into the model. 

##School Fees Model

This model will take the form:

\begin{equation}
y_i = \alpha + \textbf{X}_{i1}\beta + \textbf{X}_{i2} \cdot X_{i4} \gamma + \textbf{X}_{i2} \delta + \textbf{X}_{i4} \zeta + X_{i3} \theta + \pi_i + \epsilon_i 
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i1}$ represents a matrix of expressive benefit indicators and $\beta$ represents a vector of coefficients for each expressive benefit indicator.
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i2}$ represents a matrix of self-interest indicators, $X_{i4}$ represents a binary indicator for school contact, and $\textbf{X}_{i2} \cdot X_{i4}$ represents interations between each self-interest indicator and school contact. $\gamma$ represents a vector of coefficients for the interaction terms, $\delta$ represents the vector of coefficients for self interest terms alone, and $\zeta$ represents the coefficient of the school contact indicator alone.
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i3}$ represents a matrix of control variables, and $\theta$ represents a vector of coefficients for each control variable.
  \item $\pi_i$ represents country fixed effects.
\end{itemize}

Note that symbolic attitudes and self-interest are thus *not* summary indices (except in cases indicated under variable construction); rather, each indictor is entered individually into the model. 

###Robustness check

As an alternative to the interactive model used above, we will also conduct a robustness check in which we subset to only respondents with a 1 for school contact, and use model (1) estimate effects and test relevant hypotheses.

#Hypothesis Testing

For each model, we will conduct two joint F-test. The first will consider whether expressive benefits indicators are jointly significant, and the second will consider whether material self-interest indicators are jointly significant. 

##Expressive Benefits

The F-test for joint significance of expressive benefits indicators has the following hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}

\item For Model 1 (immigration, privatization): 

\begin{itemize}

\item $H_0$ :$\gamma = \textbf{0}$

\item $H_A$: $\beta \neq \textbf{0}$

\end{itemize}

Hence, the restricted model will be $y_i = \alpha + \textbf{X}_{i1}\beta + \textbf{X}_{i3}\delta + \pi_i + \epsilon_i$.

\item For Model 2 (school fees): 

\begin{itemize}

\item $H_0$: $\beta = \textbf{0}$

\item $H_A$: $\beta \neq 0$

\end{itemize}

Hence, the restricted model will be $y_i = \alpha + \textbf{X}_{i1}\beta + \textbf{X}_{i2} \cdot X_{i4} \gamma + \textbf{X}_{i2} \delta + \textbf{X}_{i4} \zeta + X_{i3} \theta + \pi_i + \epsilon_i$.

\end{enumerate}

##Self-interest

The F-test for joint significance of self-interest indicators has the following hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Model 1 (immigration, privatization):

\begin{itemize}

\item $H_0$: $\beta_2 = \textbf{0}$

\item $H_A$: $\beta_2 \neq \textbf{0}$

\end{itemize}

Hence, the restricted model will be $y_i = \alpha + \textbf{X}_{i1}\beta + X_{i3} \theta + \pi_i + \epsilon_i$.

\item For Model 2 (school fees): 

\begin{itemize}

\item $H_0$: $\gamma = \delta = \zeta = \textbf{0}$

\item $H_A$: $\text{at least one} \{\gamma, \delta, \zeta\} \neq 0$

\end{itemize}

Hence, the restricted model will be $y_i = \alpha + \textbf{X}_{i2}\gamma + \textbf{X}_{i3}\delta + \pi_i + \epsilon_i$.

\end{enumerate}

##Standard errors

For both joint F-test, we will use cluster-robust standard errors, with primary sampling units as the cluster.

#Procedures for Missing Data

We will consider the problem of missing data separately for each model. In each model, if less than 5% of observations contain missing data on at least one covariate, we will simply drop missing observations. If 5% or more of observations contain missing data on at least one covariate, we will impute missing data.

#Multiple hypothesis testing

We will use the Benjamimi-Hochberg Procedure to address false discovery through multiple hypothesis testing. In other words, we will:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Order the p-values for each of $m$ hypothesis tests such that $p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \ldots \leq p_m$.
  \item Maximize $k$ such that $p_i \leq \frac{\alpha \cdot k}{m}$. This value will be $k^*$.
  \item Reject all hypotheses $H_k$ for $k \leq k^*$
\end{itemize}
