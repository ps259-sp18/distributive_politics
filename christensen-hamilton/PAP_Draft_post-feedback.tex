\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In his 1957 classic \textit{An Economic Theory of Democracy}, Anthony
Downs adopts as a key assumption of his model that ``cititzens act
rationally in politics'' (1957, 36). That is, citizens cast votes aimed
a maximizing their benefits from government. Downs allows that utility
can be derived from altruistic action, not only from their material
income or benefits. Nonetheless, research on voting behavior continues
to conceptualize voting as a rational and self-intersted act. For
instance, the oft-cited Meltzer-Richard model posits that voters take
into account their position in the income distribution and vote to
establish a system of taxation that maximizes their private material
self-interest (1981).

Mounting evidence suggests this idealized notion of a rational and
materially self-interested voter is not representative of reality.
Automatic emotional responses are now understood to play an important
role in information processing and decision making. For instance,
Charles S. Taber and Milton Lodge have collected evidence of ``hot
cognition,'' wherein political stimuli automatically and rapidly trigger
an affective charge from long-term memory; these affective charges
influence subsequent cognition (Lodge and Taber 2005; Morris et al.
2003). Such affectively charged cognitions falls short of the idealized
rational cognition pervasive in political science models.

Recognizing the role of affect in preference formation, David Sears and
coauthors developed a theory of symbolic politics (Sears et al. 1980;
Sears, Hensler, and Speer 1979; Lau, Brown, and Sears 1978). Under this
theory, citizens form predispositions toward political objects or
symbols early in life that remain relatively stable over a lifetime.
Later in life, exposure to stimulus reminiscent of that political symbol
triggers an affectively charged response based on longstanding
predispositions. The need for cognitive consistency outweights present
material self-interest. As a result, ``Political attitudes\ldots{} are
formed mainly in congruence with long-standing values about society and
the polity, rather than short-term instrumentalities for satisfaction of
one's current private needs'' (1980, 671). As a classic example,
individuals most involed in anti-Vietnam war protest did not have much
literal personal skin in game. They came from populations protected from
the draft -- young women, as well as young men who received higher
education exemptions from the draft. Symbolic predispositions better
explain their actions than material self-interest.

In order to gain empirical traction on the theory, Sears and coauthors
adopt a limited definition of self-interested attitudes as those that
are ``directed toward maximizing gains or minimizing losses to the
individual's tangible private well-being,'' excluding other forms of
utility such as value expression (1979, 369). They chose measure of
self-interest that are as fine-grained and direct as possible. Measuring
self-interest with demographic variables, for instance, is problematic
because it fails to differentiate between current self-interest and
pre-adult socialization. Using U.S. polling data, they found that
symbolic predispositions (such as racial prejudice, nationalism,
ideology, or party identification) explained far greater variation in
attitudes toward the Vietnam war, unemployment policy, national health
insurance, busing, and law and order than did material self-interest.

Our aim is to apply the symbolic politics theory to a new population. We
will do so by leveraging World Values Survey and Afrobarometer questions
that appopriately guage policy preference, symbolic predispositions, and
material self-interest on four topics: immigration, privatization,
education spending, and ebola prevention spending. We plan to
investigate (1) whether symbolic predispositions and private material
self-interest each have any explanatory potential over policy
preferences, and (2) whether symbolic predispositions has greater
explanatory potential than material self-interest.

Owing to the difficult of manipulating either symbolic predispositions
or material self-interest, our investigation will not be causally
identified. Moreover, we recognize that some of our item measures are
less than ideal owing to limitations of using pre-existing data.
Nonetheless, we believe this project could make several important
contributions to the literature. First, to our knowledge, the theory of
symbolic politics has not been applied outside the United States and
Europe. Applying the theory in sub-Saharan Africa presents a new test
for the theory in a new context. In particular, mayn psychological
theories have not been adequately tested in non-WEIRD, i.e.~non-Western,
educated, industrialized, rich, democratic, societies (Henrich, Heine,
and Norenzayan 2010); this project will help to rectify this imbalance
in psychology research.

Second, debate remains over the circumstances in which symbolic
attitudes dominate policy preferences over self-interest (Hunt et al.
2010; Weeden and Kurzban 2017; Sears et al. 1980; Kim, Stark, and
Borgida 2011; Crano 1997; Sears 1997). Testing symbolic politics in a
new arena could help resolve this debate.

Third, this project will contribute to the African ethnic voting
literature. An instrumental explanation suggests that ethnic voting is a
rational response to competition for scarce resources, wherein voters
expect elected politicians to preferentially distribute goods to
coethnics (Bates 1982; K. E. Ferree 2006). However, recent research has
shed light on the limits of this logic. Ethnic voting is neither
guaranteed nor universal, but rather moderated by political institutions
(Posner 2005), social institutions (Dunning and Harrison 2010),
geography (ICHINO and NATHAN 2013; Basedau and Stroh 2012), and
political performance (Bratton, Bhavnani, and Chen 2012; Carlson 2015;
K. Ferree and Horowitz 2010). Moreover, ethnic favoritism in the
distribution of goods may not be as pervasive as once thought (Kasara
2007; Kramon and Posner 2013; Burgess et al. 2015). If ethnic group
identity is a powerful symbolic attitude, political mobilization along
ethnic lines may persist \emph{irrationally} even where ethnic bias in
service provision has faded. This persistence of symbolic attitudes may
lead us to question models that assume rational voter behavior; for
instance, it could explain the null results in Metaketa I. On the other
hand, if ethnic identity is not dominant in determining policy
preference, we will add to the literature suggesting limits to ethnic
voting.

\section{Description of data}\label{description-of-data}

In this study we plan to utilize data from the World Values Survey and
Afrobarometer surveys. The World Values Survey (WVS) is the largest and
longest-running non-commercial cross-national survey of beliefs and
values. The most recently completed wave surveyed participants from
almost 100 countries in 2011-2014. Each country-level survey has a
minimum of 1,200 respondents (ages 18-85), conducted through
face-to-face interviews. Depending on the country, sampling occurs
through either probability or a combination of probability and
stratified random sampling as noted in the documentation. From these
countries, we identify the five that are in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana,
Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.

Afrobarometer is a long running survey designed specifically to
understand political attitudes and behaviors in sub-Saharan Africa.
Respondents answer questions on a variety of topics including public
services, governance, identity, and political participation. There have
been six completed waves, with the most recent in 2014/2015 also
covering the most countries (36). Most country surveys have either 1,200
or 2,400 respondents. Each survey uses a clustered, stratified,
multi-stage, area probability sample. Occasionally a survey will
oversample a politically relevant sub-population in order to ensure a
large-enough subsample.

From these two sources we identify the four policy preference choices
available to us as listed above. In order for a policy preference
question to be included in our analysis, the relevant survey also had to
contain appropriate items to identify the self-interest and symbolic
attitudes of respondents, hence why so few policy preference items were
included.

For each topic we use different samples of countries based on the data
available. The relevant questions on immigration and privatization are
contained in the WVS and so is limited to those five countries. The
relevant data on Ebola from the Afrobarometer surveys in Liberia and
Sierra Leone. We limit our analysis of education preferences to
countries where there is not compelling evidence of ethnic preference in
education outcomes. If ethnic preferences exist, then symbolic politics
(ethnic identity) and self-interest point in the same direction and are
difficult to disentangle. We select countries for inclusion using Franck
and Rainer's results on systematic bias in primary education attainment
and literacy (2012). We limit our analysis to only countries in which no
more than one of their four indicators attained statistical
significance. This leaves us with data from five countries.

In early stages of this project, concerns were cited regarding general
Ebola knowledge and the prevalence of Ebola mythology in Liberia and
Sierra Leone. If respondents lacked knowledge of Ebola, they might not
be able to appropriately assess their own self interest and the
consequences of the policies they advocate. We believe this should not
be a concern. Mythology and knowledge gaps were common at the outbreak
of the Ebola epidemic in 2013. However, Afrobarometer's Round 6 survey
was not administered in Liberia and Sierra Leone until 2015, well after
a series of public information campaigns aimed at improving knowledge
and dispelling myths began. We believe there is sufficient evidence of
sufficient Ebola knowledge for participants to answer the survey
questions posed (Kobayashi et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2016; Wilken et al.
2017).

\section{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}

Based on the original findings of the Sears and coauthors' papers, we
expect that both expressive benefits and and self-interest will be
jointly significant in the model for each question considered.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Model}\label{model}

\textit{Note: We are still deciding which model would be most appropriate, as response variables are not binary but they are bounded from 0 to 1. Logit might be better? We will determine this before finalizing our PAP.}

For each policy area, we will run an OLS regression with policy
preference as the dependent variable and with symbolic attitudes and
self-interest indices as the independent variables. We will also control
for demographic variables including gender, age, education, and
ethnicity. Thus, the model will take the form:

\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \textbf{X}_{i1}\beta_1 + \textbf{X}_{i2}\beta_2 +  \textbf{X}_{i3}\beta_3 + \epsilon_i 
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i1}$ represents a matrix of symbolic attitudes indicators and $\beta_1$ represents a vector of coefficients for each symbolic attitude indicator.
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i2}$ represents a matrix of self-interest indicators and $\beta_2$ represents a vector of coefficients for each self-interest indicator.
  \item $\textbf{X}_{i3}$ represents a matrix of control variables and $\beta_3$ represents a vector of coefficients for each control variable.
\end{itemize}

Note that symbolic attitudes and self-interest are thus \emph{not}
summary indices; rather, each indictor is entered individually into the
model. This replicates the original methodology used in Sears and
coauthors' series of symbolic politics papers (Sears, Hensler, and Speer
1979; Sears et al. 1980).

\section{Hypothesis tests}\label{hypothesis-tests}

For each model, we will conduct the following hypothesis tests:

\subsection{Joint F tests}\label{joint-f-tests}

To test whether symbolic attitudes and material self-interest each
contribute to the formation of policy preferences, we will use joint
F-tests. These test are NOT drawn from the Sears and coauthors papers,
which only consider the statistical significance of each covariate
individually.

\paragraph{Symbolic Attitudes}\label{symbolic-attitudes}

Recalling that \(\beta_1\) is a vector of coefficients on all symbolic
attitude covariates, the F-test for joint significance of symbolic
attitudes indicators has the following hypotheses:

\[\begin{aligned}
H_0 \  &: \beta_1 = \textbf{0}\\ H_A&: \beta_1 \neq \textbf{0}
\end{aligned}\]

Hence, the restricted model will be

\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \textbf{X}_{i2}\beta_2 +  \textbf{X}_{i3}\beta_3 + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Self-interest}\label{self-interest}

Recalling that \(\beta_2\) is a vector of coefficients on all
self-interest covariates, the F-test for joint significance of
self-interest indicators has the following hypotheses:

\[\begin{aligned}
H_0\ &: \beta_2 = \textbf{0}\\ H_A &: \beta_2 \neq \textbf{0}
\end{aligned}\]

Hence, the restricted model will be

\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \textbf{X}_{i1}\beta_1 +  \textbf{X}_{i3}\beta_3 + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Standard errors}\label{standard-errors}

For both joint F-test, we will use cluster-robust standard errors, with
primary sampling units as the cluster.

\subsection{R-squared comparison test}\label{r-squared-comparison-test}

In the original Sears and coauthors analysis compared the relative
contribution of symbolic attitudes and self-interest to policy
preferences by comparing the \(R^2\) contribution made by each set of
covariates. For instance, the contribution of symbolic attitudes will
be:

\[R^2_{\text{symbolic}} = R^2_1 - R^2_2\]

where

\begin{itemize}
  \item $R^2_{\text{symbolic}}$ represents the explanatory contribution of symbolic attitudes.
  \item $R^2_1$ represents the coefficent of determination for the full model, including symbolic attitude indicators, self-interest indicators, and control variables (equation 1).
  \item $R^2_2$ represents the coefficient of determination for the restricted model which excludes symbolic attitude indicators, but includes both self-interest indicators and control variables (equation 2).
\end{itemize}

Using the same technique, the contribution of self-interest will be:

\[R^2_{\text{self-interest}} = R^2_1 - R^2_3\]

where

\begin{itemize}
  \item $R^2_{\text{self-interest}}$ represents the explanatory contribution of self interest.
  \item $R^2_1$ represents the coefficent of determination for the full model, including symbolic attitude indicators, self-interest indicators, and control variables (equation 1).
  \item $R^2_2$ represents the coefficient of determination for the restricted model which excludes self-interest indicators, but includes both symbolic attitudes indicators and control variables (equation 2).
\end{itemize}

We will also use these estimates. Because the number of items for
self-interest and symbolic attitudes varies, we will use adjusted
\(R^2\) in all analysis; for instance, we would not want to bias our
results simply because the battery of symbolic attitude items is longer
than than the battery of self-interest items. In addition, we will
extend the original analysis by estimating the standard errors of the
\(R^2\) contributions using bootstrapping, enabling us to assess more
rigorously whether contribution of either symbolic attitudes or
self-interest clearly outweights the other. Thus, we will test the
following hypotheses:

\[\begin{aligned}
H_0 \ &: R^2_{\text{symbolic}} - R^2_{\text{self-interest}} = 0\\ H_A&: R^2_{\text{symbolic}} - R^2_{\text{self-interest}} \neq 0
\end{aligned}\]

We will conduct 10,000 bootstraps to estimate standard errors. Our goal
is to maintain consistency between the original sampling procedure and
our bootstrap resampling method. However, we face certain practical
limitations.

\textit{Disclaimer: We are not yet settled on our bootstrapping procedure and will seek further advice before finalizing our PAP.}

Afrobarometer uses consistent sampling policies across countries and
across survey rounds. For Afrobaromter questions, we will (1) divide the
data back into country samples, (2) stratify the data by urban and rural
PSUs within each country, and (3) resample PSUs within each strata. The
World Values Survey does not use consistent sampling methods across
countries. As such, we resample according to the lowest common
denominator among country sampling procedures (1) divide the data back
into country samples, and (2) resample PSUs within each country.

\subsection{Sub-group analyses}\label{sub-group-analyses}

In their 1980 paper, Sears and coathors also examine results from a
series of sub-group analyses on the premise that self-interest may be
more prominent in preference formation under certain circumstances.
i.e.~within certain groups. They developed indices for political
sophistication, private-regarding values, perceived government
responsiveness, sense of political efficacy, and perceiving the issue as
a very important problem.

\textit{Looking for feedback: Should we subset within each country and then re-aggregate, or should we simply sub-set the merged data?}

\paragraph{Political Sophistication}\label{political-sophistication}

This subgroup analysis is of greatest importance for Sears and
coauthors, as rationally self-interested behavior presumes the
availability of adequate information. In their 1980 analysis, they
measure political sophistication using a composite index of education,
basic political knowledge, self-reported interest in the ongoing
political campaign, and the number of media in which the campaign was
followed (Sears et al. 1980). Following the discussion of political
sophistication measures by John Zaller (Zaller 1992), we do not
replicate Sears and coauthors' composite index and instead use a summary
index based solely on political knowledge. These data are available for
the Afrobarometer question from Round 3 only (preference on school
fees), so this is the only policy on which we complete this sub-group
analysis.

To measure political sophistication, we use an additive index based on
the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Can you tell me the name of: Your deputy name at the National Assembly?
  \item Can you tell me the name of: Your local government councilor?
  \item Can you tell me the name of: Your Deputy President?
  \item Do you happen to know which is the political party with the most seats at the National Assembly?
  \item Do you happen to know how many times a person can be elected president?
  \item Do you happen to know who is responsible of determining if a law is constitutional or not?
\end{enumerate}

Please note that Afrobarometer questionnaires for individual countries
are customized to include appropriate terms for each country (e.g.~MP
versus deputy). We code 1 for the correct response, as identified by
Afrobarometer enumerators, and 0 for all other responses (including
``know but can't remember'').

Like Sears and coauthors (1980), we will split the participant pool at
the median and rerun the tests separately on each half (below median and
above median).

\paragraph{Private-regarding values}\label{private-regarding-values}

The World Values Survey contains questions that will allow us to measure
private-regarding values. We assess private-regarding using Schwartz
values questions which describe traits of a hypothetical person and ask
the respondent how similar they believe they are to the hypothetical. We
will create an additive index based on the following questions, with
responses to each question normalized on a scale from 0 to 1.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (V70) It is important to this person to think up new ideas and be creative; to do things one’s own way. Response options: (1) very much like me, like me, somewhat like me, a little like me, not like me, not like me at all (0)
  \item (V71) It is important to this person to be rich; to have a lot of money and expensive things. Response options: (1) very much like me, like me, somewhat like me, a little like me, not like me, not like me at all (0)
  \item (V74) It is important to this person to do something for the good of society. Response options: (0) very much like me, like me, somewhat like me, a little like me, not like me, not like me at all (1)
  \item (V75) It is important to help people living nearby; to care for their needs. Response options: (0) very much like me, like me, somewhat like me, a little like me, not like me, not like me at all (1)
\end{enumerate}

We will split the sample at the median, rerunning our analysis
separately on each half.

\textit{Again, should we split within each country or within the merged sample?}

\paragraph{Perceived government
responsiveness}\label{perceived-government-responsiveness}

Afrobarometer Round 3 contains several questions which allow us to
measure perceived government responsiveness, allowing us to subset our
data for policy preferences on school fees. We will create an additive
index based on the following questions, with responses to each question
normalized on a scale from 0 to 1.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How much of the time do think the following try their best to listen to what people like you have to say: Members of Parliament? Response options: (0) never, only sometimes, often, always (1)
  \item How much of the time do think the following try their best to listen to what people like you have to say: Local Government Councillors? Response options: (0) never, only sometimes, often, always (1)
  \item Taking the Problem you mentioned first [as the highest prioirity problem facing the country], how likely is it that the government will solve your most important problem within the next few years? Reponse options: (0) not at all likely, likely, not very likely, likely, very likely (1)
\end{enumerate}

We will split the sample at the median, rerunning our analysis
separately on each half.

\textit{Again, should we split within each country or within the merged sample?}

\paragraph{Sense of political
efficacy}\label{sense-of-political-efficacy}

Afrobarometer Round 3 contains a question on political efficacy,
allowing us to conduct this sub-group analysis for question. This
question reads: ``Do you agree or disagree with the following
statements? Politics and government sometimes seem so complicated that
you can't really understand what's going on.'' We divide respondents
into those who agree (includes both agree and strongly agree) and those
who disagree (both disagree and strongly disagree), dropping those who
respond with ``neither agree or disagree'' or ``don't know''. We
replicate our analysis on each sub-group.

\paragraph{Issue importance}\label{issue-importance}

For our school fees question from Afrobarometer Round 3, we will divide
respondents into those who identified education as an important problem
(regardless of whether first, second, or third choice) and those who did
not, rerunning our tests on each subset.

\textit{Note: we are also considering adding analysis specified by Crano in a critique of Sears and coauthors' original work, which examines vested interest as a moderator between symbolic attitudes and policy preference}
(Crano 1997).

\section{Multiple hypothesis testing}\label{multiple-hypothesis-testing}

We will use the Benjamimi-Hochberg Procedure to address false discovery
through multiple hypothesis testing. In other words, we will:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Order the p-values for each of $m$ hypothesis tests such that $p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \ldots \leq p_m$.
  \item Maximize $k$ such that $p_i \leq \frac{\alpha \cdot k}{m}$. This value will be $k^*$.
  \item Reject all hypotheses $H_k$ for $k \leq k^*$
\end{itemize}
