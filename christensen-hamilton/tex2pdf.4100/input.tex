\subsection{Theoretical Problem, Main Hypotheses, and
Contributions}\label{theoretical-problem-main-hypotheses-and-contributions}

Sub-optimal allocation of political goods may arise not due to nefarious
politicians or special interests but because citizens in a democratic
society express preference for sub-optimal allocation. Manin,
Przeworski, and Stokes {[}-@przeworski\_democracy\_1999{]} describe how
such sub-optimal allocations can arise when poltiicians pander to voter
preferences that are not in the voters' best interests. Within the
American politics literature, the theory of symbolic politics can
explain why and when voters hold preferences contrary to their objective
material self-interests {[}@sears\_whites\_1979,
@sears\_self-interest\_1980{]}. Individuals acquire predispositions
toward political objects through socialization at a young age which
guide preferences later in life; in particular, symbolic politics theory
emphasizes racial prejudice, political ideology, and partisan
identification as drivers of political preferences. As far as we are
aware, this theory has not yet been applied in an African context.
Especially in light of recent research that demonstrates the limits of
ethnic favoritism in the distribution of African political goods
{[}@kasara\_tax\_2007, @kramon\_who\_2013, @burgess\_value\_2015{]}, the
question of whether ethnic identity drives distributive preferences
rather than material self-interest merits investigation.

We will investigate the following hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
\item Symbolic predispositions toward ethnic identity, party identity, and political ideology explain greater variation in African distributive preferences than material self-interest.
\item Symbolic predispositions will explain greater variation in abstract or generalized issue attitudes, but less variation in attitudes toward issues with clear and immediate impact on individuals' lives.
\item The explanatory potential of symbolic predispositions will vary by country. For instance, we expect ethnic identity to explain greater variation in distribute preference in Kenya than in Tanzania, as ethnic identity is less salient historically in the latter.
\end{itemize}

This project will make the following contributions to the literature:

\begin{itemize}
\item If symbolic politics explains greater variation in distributive preferences than material self-interest, one implication will be that welfare enhancement may not accompany democratization.
\item If material self-interest explains greater variation in distributive preference than symbolic predispositions like ethnic identity, we will clarify the debate over the salience of ethnic identity in African politics.
\item Our project will expand the literature on political psychology to developing countries, where it has not been extensively applied.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Countries (context)
studied}\label{countries-context-studied}

We propose to use individual-level data collected in the sixth round of
the Afrobarometer survey (2014, 2015) to study this topic. We will use
two measurements as dependent outcomes. The first outcome is participant
response to a question (Q65C) asked to respondents in all 36 countries
about willingness to have taxes raised if it results in better access to
health care. The second outcome is a question (Q86F-LIB) asking
respondents in Liberia and Sierra Leone how much they agree with the
statement ``The government should devote many more resources to
combating Ebola even if this means that less money is spent on things
like education.'' We will measure self-interest through questions that
measure exposure to ebola such as having close relatives or friends who
contracted Ebola, as well as how ebola disrupted their regular lives.
